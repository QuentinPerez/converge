In this tutorial we're going to step through basic Converge usage by creating a
small "hello world" module. Before beginning, please make sure to
[install Converge]({{< ref "install.md" >}}). You can test your installation by
issuing `converge version`.

## Hello World!

We'll begin by writing a small module using the [file.content]({{< ref
"resources/file.content.md" >}}) resource. Put the following into
`helloWorld.hcl`:

```hcl
file.content "render" {
  destination = "hello.txt"
  content     = "Hello, World!"
}
```

## Planning

This is our first module! Let's plan out our execution first by running
`converge plan --local helloWorld.hcl`:

```sh
$ converge plan --local helloWorld.hcl
2016-09-20T08:05:31-05:00 |WARN| setting session-local token	token=309b7660-a0b1-4a88-9fa4-d5f2a139b8de
2016-09-20T08:05:31-05:00 |INFO| serving	addr=:47740 component=rpc
2016-09-20T08:05:31-05:00 |WARN| skipping module verification	component=client
2016-09-20T08:05:31-05:00 |INFO| got status	component=client file=helloWorld.hcl id=root/file.content.render run=STARTED stage=PLAN
2016-09-20T08:05:31-05:00 |INFO| got status	component=client file=helloWorld.hcl id=root run=STARTED stage=PLAN

root/file.content.render:
    Messages:
    Has Changes: yes
    Changes:
        hello.txt: "<file-missing>" => "Hello, World!"

Summary: 0 errors, 1 changes
```

You can see our single file is going to be rendered at "hello.txt", and the file
will be created. When created, it will say "Hello, World!" Planning out your
changes is usually a good idea; all of Converge's resource types support planned
output.

## Applying

Next, let's actually make the changes, using `converge apply --local helloWorld.hcl`:

```sh
$ converge apply --local helloWorld.hcl
2016-09-20T08:06:21-05:00 |WARN| setting session-local token	token=4d9f2774-8ed1-4dc4-8db5-a359b275b3b5
2016-09-20T08:06:21-05:00 |INFO| serving	addr=:47740 component=rpc
2016-09-20T08:06:21-05:00 |WARN| skipping module verification	component=client
2016-09-20T08:06:21-05:00 |INFO| got status	component=client file=helloWorld.hcl id=root/file.content.render run=STARTED stage=APPLY
2016-09-20T08:06:21-05:00 |INFO| got status	component=client file=helloWorld.hcl id=root run=STARTED stage=APPLY

root/file.content.render:
    Messages:
    Has Changes: yes
    Changes: No changes

Summary: 0 errors, 1 changes
```

This looks *suspiciously* similar to the output from before. That's good,
because it means Converge made exactly (and only) the changes that it planned
out. If we check by opening "hello.txt" in an editor, we'll see that it says
"Hello, World!"

## The Graph

So what's actually going on here? Converge is taking your module file and
turning it into a graph, then walking over the graph in order to make changes.
Right now we only have one resource, so the graph is pretty simple:

{{< figure src="/images/getting-started/hello-world.png"
           caption="The graph of our hello world module. Root (represented as /) depends on the file we defined." >}}

(By the way, you can find more information about this in [Dependencies]({{< ref
"dependencies.md" >}}))

## Divergence!

Converge doesn't just create resources, though: it also makes sure they stay up
to date. While you're in your editor, go ahead and change the message to
something else. I changed mine to "LOL World!" Once you've done that, run the
plan again.

```sh
$ converge plan --local helloWorld.hcl
2016-09-20T08:07:02-05:00 |WARN| setting session-local token	token=c61a0f03-2f4d-43cd-9722-1482e6396b70
2016-09-20T08:07:02-05:00 |INFO| serving	addr=:47740 component=rpc
2016-09-20T08:07:02-05:00 |WARN| skipping module verification	component=client
2016-09-20T08:07:02-05:00 |INFO| got status	component=client file=helloWorld.hcl id=root/file.content.render run=STARTED stage=PLAN
2016-09-20T08:07:02-05:00 |INFO| got status	component=client file=helloWorld.hcl id=root run=STARTED stage=PLAN

root/file.content.render:
    Messages:
    Has Changes: yes
    Changes:
        hello.txt: "LOL World!" => "Hello, World!"

Summary: 0 errors, 1 changes
```

We see that we're going to change our message back to what's specified in the
module. Handy! A quick `converge apply helloWorld.hcl` and we're back to normal.

## Params

Now let's add the ability to greet someone in particular, instead of the whole
world. We're going to use [params]({{< ref "resources/param.md" >}}) for this.
Change your `helloWorld.hcl` to look like this:

```hcl
param "name" {
  default = "World"
}

file.content "render" {
  destination = "hello.txt"
  content     = "Hello, {{param `name`}}!"
}
```

This [param]({{< ref "resources/param.md" >}}) allows us to add a parameter to
our module when we call it. (Notice that we're using the result of our parameter
in a template block in the `content` stanza of `file.content.render`.)

{{< note title="Templates" >}}
Converge uses Go's `text/template` library. You can template most stanzas in
your resources. The
[Go Documentation on `text/template`](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) is
a handy reference to keep around as you're finding your feet with these
templates.
{{< /note >}}

Let's change the name in the template to your name (I'm going to assume it's
"Spartacus".) We'll use the `-p` flag to `converge plan` to see what'll happen:

```sh
$ converge plan --local -p name=Spartacus helloWorld.hcl
2016-09-20T08:07:51-05:00 |WARN| setting session-local token	token=376ae4d9-8c7a-4581-be05-4c3cb8401798
2016-09-20T08:07:51-05:00 |INFO| serving	addr=:47740 component=rpc
2016-09-20T08:07:51-05:00 |WARN| skipping module verification	component=client
2016-09-20T08:07:51-05:00 |INFO| got status	component=client file=helloWorld.hcl id=root/param.name run=STARTED stage=PLAN
2016-09-20T08:07:51-05:00 |INFO| got status	component=client file=helloWorld.hcl id=root/file.content.render run=STARTED stage=PLAN
2016-09-20T08:07:51-05:00 |INFO| got status	component=client file=helloWorld.hcl id=root run=STARTED stage=PLAN

root/file.content.render:
    Messages:
    Has Changes: yes
    Changes:
        hello.txt: "Hello, World!" => "Hello, Spartacus!"

Summary: 0 errors, 1 changes
```

Makes sense, right? When we provide the param, it's value is used instead of the
default of "World".

By the way, how does this effect our graph? Well, we've added a new resource.
Normally, you'd have to [explicitly specify dependencies]({{< ref
"dependencies.md" >}}), but Converge will look inside our template strings for
references to Params. That means our graph is all hooked up, and looks like
this:

{{< figure src="/images/getting-started/hello-world-params.png"
           caption="Our graph with parameter. The file now depends on the name parameter." >}}

## Modules Calling Modules

This is all well and good, but we don't want to have to write things the same
*every time* right? Well, good news: that's what modules are for! Now that
you've written a module, you can require it from any other module to add it to
your tree. Create a new module, let's call it `helloYou.hcl`:

```hcl
module "helloWorld.hcl" "hello" {
  params {
    name = "Spartacus"
  }
}
```

Now try running `converge plan helloYou.hcl`. The same thing happens as if you
had called the module yourself!

But once again, how does this effect our graph? You remember before that we had
a root, a file resource, and a param resource. We still have all those things,
but with a wrinkle: we've seen `/` as our root module in all the previous
diagrams, but `/` is really just an alias for the root. Since we're not
requiring `helloWorld.hcl` from `helloYou.hcl`, Converge will reason about it as
a separate module. But really, these are all part of the same tree, and Converge
will walk over them as nodes.

{{< figure src="/images/getting-started/hello-you.png"
           caption="Our graph, but with our original module as a dependent module." >}}

## Conditional Evaluation

Converge supports the ability to conditionally execute a set of actions
depending on the value of expressions that are evaluated at runtime.  This
allows you to create a single converge file that will operate differently
depending on parameters passed to coverge at execution time, information present
about the system during run time, or the status of other processes that have
executed.  If you are already familiar with `switch` statements from other
languages you may wish to skip ahead to the section on *Rules of Conditionals*

To understand how this works, let's consider the following example:  You wish to
create a file, `greeting.txt` that contains a greeting like `hello`, however you
want to be aware of the users preferred language so you would like to ensure
that the content of the greeting file is in an appropriate language.  Let's look
at an example, `helloLanguages.hcl`:

```hcl
param "lang" {
  default = ""
}
switch "test-switch" {
  case "eq `spanish` `{{param `lang`}}`" "spanish" {
    file.content "foo-file" {
      destination = "greeting.txt"
      content     = "hola\n"
    }
  }
  case "eq `french` `{{param `lang`}}`" "french" {
    file.content "foo-file" {
      destination = "greeting.txt"
      content     = "salut\n"
    }
  }
  case "eq `japanese` `{{param `lang`}}`" "japanese" {
    file.content "foo-file" {
      destination = "greeting.txt"
      content     = "もしもし\n"
    }
  }
  default {
    file.content "foo-file" {
      destination = "greeting.txt"
      content     = "hello\n"
    }
  }
}
```

Here we define a *conditional* clause using the keyword `switch`, which contains
several *branches*, defined with they keyword `case`.  Each *branch* contains
one or more *child* resources that define what should happen when the *branch*
is executed.

Let's graph this file and get an idea of how it looks:

`converge graph --local helloLanguages.hcl | dot -Tpng -o hello-languages.png`

{{< figure src="/images/getting-started/hello-languages.png"
           caption="A graph displaying many possible branches." >}}

We can see that our `switch` and `case` statements are each transformed into
*macro expressions* in the graph, denoted by their names.  Each of these nodes
represent a potential runnable action on the system.  The determination of what,
if any, of these actions will be run is dependent on the results of branch
evaluation.

*Branch evaluation* refers to the process of evaluating a *predicate* to
determine whether a branch may be run, and if so looking at the other branches
to determine whether the current branch has priority.  Branches are evaluated
top-to-bottom and the first branch that is true will be the one that is
executed.  The special branch `default` is one whose predicate will always
evaluate to `true`.

{{< note title="Fall-Through" >}}
If you're familiar with `switch` statments in other languages you should keep in
mind that converge branches do not support fall-through.  You do not need to
specify `break` to end a `case` statement, and there is no supported way of
evaluating multiple branches in a single `switch` statement. The first
(top-to-bottom) `case` with a true `predicate` is the one that is evalauted.
{{< /note >}}

*predicate*s are evaluated like other templates in converge, and may reference
`param`s, and perform `lookup`s on other values in the system.  A *predicate*
may not reference any of it's *child* resourceses.  The value of the predicate
is it's truth value:  The strings `t` and `true` (case insensitive) are `true`
values and will cause the *branch* to be evaluated.  The strings `f` and `false`
(case insensitive) will cause the *branch* to remain unevaluated.  Any other
value is an error.

### Rules of Conditionals

  * `switch` statements must have a name
  * `case` statements must have a name and a predicate
  * `case` statements may not be named *case*, *switch*, or *default*
  * `default` statements must not have a name or a predicate
  * predicates must evaluate to one of: *t*, *true*, *f*, *false*
  * branches may not contain `module` references
  * predicates may reference `param`s and `lookup` resources outside of the
    switch statement
  * child nodes may refrence `param`s and `lookup` resources outside of the
    switch statement or within the same branch
  * no resource may reference anything that is part of a branch that it does not
    belong to
  * root and module level resources may not reference fields inside of a switch
    statement
  * only the first (top-to-bottom) true branch of a switch will be evaluated

## What's Next?

A great next step is to try and make something simple with Converge! Try
installing something from Brew, if you're running on OSX, or symlinking a
dotfile into place.

If you're ready, you can
[read about how all those dependencies *actually work*]({{< ref
"dependencies.md" >}})!
